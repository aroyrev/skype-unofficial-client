##### What is this?

An unofficial client of Skype for Linux, running on top of Node Webkit.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haskellcamargo/skype-unofficial-client/master/resource/example/demo.png)

##### Why?

Because Skype native client for Linux sucks a lot.

##### Installation

Skype Unofficial Client is currently available for Linux x86 and x64 and
unix-based systems.

`git clone https://github.com/haskellcamargo/skype-unofficial-client.git`

`sudo make linux_x86` or `sudo make linux_x64`

For Arch Linux users, this application is currently available on [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/skype-desktop-bin/). 

`yaourt skype-desktop-bin `

Run the application by `/opt/skype_unofficial_client/skype` or through
searching for "Skype" in the main menu.

##### Developers Note

Skype's Web client running on Node Webkit, doesn't currently support video calls.

The Skype name, associated trade marks and logos and the "S" logo are trade marks of Skype or related entities.
